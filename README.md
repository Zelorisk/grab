set up ngrok in your command line, after youre done run the scripts npm run server, npx (npm exec) ngrok http 3001, and npm run client in order. 
setting up ngrok is a little complicated i guess and i dont feel like explaining it so watch a video. 
ngrok will redirect the link it provides to your localhost website.
when you run "npm run client" you should get the localhost port to be able to go to the dashboard.
after you do, create a link, and on click it will work. theres an option for the browser to give a precise and sometimes spot on location on click.
the location should be ~10-50 meters in accuracy but it will fluctuate depending on a lot of factors. 

this software is completely legal given the right use case. i do not take responsibility for anything that comes of anyone using this software.
remember, sharing locations as blackmail is illegal, as well as ddossing and posting information online without the users consent. 
this software was made as a test of what i can do as a developer. no harm was ever intended.
